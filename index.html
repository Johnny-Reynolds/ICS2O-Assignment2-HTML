He grew up in San Francisco and <br>attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his BA degree in mathematics in 1968 and his Ph.D. degree in EECS in 1976. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences</p>
  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p>Leonard solved a seven-node instance of the Hamiltonian Graph problem, an NP-complete problem similar to the travelling salesman problem. In 2002, he and his research group managed to solve a 'nontrivial' problem using DNA computation. Currently, Adleman is working on the mathematical theory of Strata. He is a Computer Science professor at the University of Southern California.</p>
